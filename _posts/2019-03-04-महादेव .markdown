We meditate one who is three-eyed absolute reality. 
We meditate one who has the King of Snakes as his garland.
We meditate one Who has smeared the body with sacred ashes.
We meditate one who is eternal and ever pure.
We meditate one who has the Four directions as his clothes. 
We mediate one who is Great Lord.
And all it permeates and nourishes like a fragrance.
Salutations to that Shiva, Who is represented by syllable "न ", 
The first syllable of the Panchakshara mantra "ॐ नमः शिवाय".
